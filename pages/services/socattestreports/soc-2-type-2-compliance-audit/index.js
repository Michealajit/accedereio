                              <p className="text-white mt-4"> One of the most important reports for third party (vendor) data security and SOX compliance is the SOC 2 Type 2 Audit. 
                              </p>
                             <p className="text-white mt-4"> The SOC 2 Type 2 attest report (also called audit report by clients) provides for compliance and assurance. SOC 2 Attestation is popularly known as SOC 2 Audit (by clients), SOC 2 Engagement, SOC 2
                              Examination, SOC 2 Certification (by clients), SOC 2 Compliance. </p>
                             <p className="text-white mt-4"> SOC 2 compliance reports are part of AICPA&apos;s SSAE 18 Attest Standard that is used for the SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 reports. SOC reportswere known as SAS 3 since 1974, and as SAS 70 audit reports since 1992. In 2011 the SOC 1 was brought under SSAE 16 Standard and SOC 2 under AT 101. Finally, in 2017 the SSAE 16 along with other SSAE standards got merged into one SSAE 18, bringing all SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 reports under SSAE 18. This is the main difference between SSAE 16 vs 18 pertaining to SOC compliance reports. AT-C section 205 provides guidance on “Examination Engagements. AICPA Guide,
                              SOC 2 Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization”. </p>
                             <p className="text-white mt-4"> SOC stands for System and Organization Controls. The definition got changed in 2017 from the earlier one as Service Organization Controls as these compliance reports were mainly being used for vendor&nbsp;(third-party) compliance audits as these organizations were service organizations. The auditor auditing these service organizations 
                             is called Service Auditor or popularly SOC Auditor. </p>

                                 <p className="mt-4"> A SOC 2 Type 2 compliance report provides for operating effectiveness of controls over a period minimum 6 months or maximum 12 months in contrast to certifications such as ISO/IEC 27001 that provides a certificate which is valid for 3 years. For missing periods or periods immediately after the report, 
                                 some User Entities or User Auditors may insist on a SOC Bridge Letter. </p>
                                 <p> A SOC 2 Type 2 compliance report usually is about 100 pages depending on the controls reported on. The Type 2 report comprises of all the applicable controls that are reported by the SOC Auditor (Service Auditor). The SOC 2 Type 2 report is now of 4 sections, Section 1 is the Auditors Opinion, Section II is the Management Assertion, Section III is the Description Criteria or System Description, and Section IV is a detailed list of controls as per 
                                 applicable TSC 2017 along with the results of the auditors&apos; test of controls.</p>

                                 <p> In comparison, an ISO/IEC 27001 does not provide such a detailed list of controls that are applicable to the entity. The SOA or Statement of Applicability of controls and details of audit or non-compliances (NC) in an ISO/IEC 27001 is between the auditor firm and the entity. These details are not shared with the end-user of the entity and these end-users or clients would not know what are the exact controls that have 
                                 been implemented by the entity or if they were operated effectively.</p>

                                <p className="mt-4"> The SOC 2 Type II compliance report uses the Trust Services Criteria (TSC) to report on the controls of an entity. Formerly they were known as the Trust Services Principles and Criteria (TSPC). The most

                                <p> The TSP 100 section covers TSC 2017 which has 5 criteria namely Security (or Common Criteria), Availability, Confidentiality, Processing Integrity, and Privacy. The common criteria itself has about 300 Points of

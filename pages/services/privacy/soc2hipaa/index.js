                       and the Final Omnibus Rule in 2013 and despite years passed by, HIPAA Privacy compliance is 
                       still a challenge for many health care organizations. We have several breach incidents 
                       relating to PII and specifically PHI. Organizations are still facing challenges in 
                       compliance and most findings relate to basic security hygiene such as risk management, 
                       policies, data minimization, and encryption. Organizations are being fined in millions 
                       and their names appear in the Wall of Shame by HHS.</p>

                        <p> New technologies are evolving, and the health care industry has moved away from paper processes and now relies heavily on the use of electronic information systems to store and process the data. The cloud movement has an impact on the healthcare industry challenges too as the majority of 
                        organizations have moved to the cloud for its various benefits. </p>
                        

                        <p> Today, healthcare providers are using clinical applications such as computerized
                         physician order entry (CPOE) systems, electronic health records (EHR), and radiology, pharmacy,
                          and laboratory systems
                         majority hosted in some sort of cloud environment.</p>

                         <p> The cloud environment is not safe either. One of the top cloud risks is the 
                         misconfigured servers that can lead to data breaches. Another major risk is insecure APIs.
                          Organizations use API&apos;s to transfer data to the business partners without a secure architecture 
                          in place and without conducting a 
                         proper vendor due diligence and evaluating the data flow lifecycle risks.</p>

                         <p> As required under the HIPAA rules the healthcare organizations are required to have a
                          Business Associate Agreement with their vendors or the third-parties. It is equally
                          important to understand the data security controls with their business associates. </p>

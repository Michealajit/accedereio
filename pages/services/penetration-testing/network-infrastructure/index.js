It is one of the most effective ways which ensures that the network is secure and cannot be hacked by malicious hackers or is prone to cyber-attacks. It helps to protect all the critical and confidential data and information which is stored and transferred over any network. 
                              </p>
                              <p  style={{marginBottom:-16}}  className="text-white mt-4">
                                Sometimes there are simulated attacks done on the networks to help test the networks security and detect potential cyber-attacks which can be done by hackers.   
                                </p>

                                      With the WFH or Hybrid work environment these days, the importance of Network security has not been reduced but rather increased due the loss of perimeter security. These days there is no LAN and entityâ€™s Firewall based controls cannot be applied to majority of the workforce.

                                      Network security is important because it keeps sensitive data safe from cyber-attacks and  keeps the systems in the network is available to the users.

                                      Network VAPT involves the use of a variety of software and hardware tools that are run on a specific LAN or a network to find the exiting vulnerabilities and patch status of systems and also to discover new systems exiting in the network.  
                                      </span>

                                      Network VAPT is critical because it can prevent hackers from gaining access to your systems  and the valuable data. Ransomware can be a typical example of compromise of Network security.

                              <p className="text-white mt-4">Traditional penetration testing methodologies are not cloud-native and only focus on processes relevant to on-premise environments. Cloud penetration testing also requires unique and specific expertise that is different from standard penetration testing. For example, cloud penetration testing would examine the security of cloud-specific configurations, cloud system passwords, cloud applications and encryption, and APIs, databases, and storage access. Cloud penetration testing is also influenced by the Shared Responsibility Model, which defines who is responsible for the components within a cloud infrastructure, platform, or software.
